Hoops - Atem Bior Basketball - Frontend Prototype
Project Overview
This repository contains a frontend prototype and design draft for a potential basketball-focused business. It serves as a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript representation of key user interface concepts, aiming to visualize the user experience for services like basketball holiday camps, coaching, and facility listings. While currently a static web page, this prototype lays the groundwork for future development into a dynamic web application or a React Native mobile application.

This project is a personal initiative to explore a business idea and apply frontend development and UI/UX design skills in a practical context. It demonstrates an understanding of modern web design principles and component-based thinking, even in its early stage.

Key Features
Responsive Navbar: A basic navigation bar with links and authentication buttons.

Hero Section: Engaging introductory section highlighting "Basketball Holiday Camps" with a call to action.

Informational Grid: Professional Instructors, bulding social and emotional skills.

Upcoming Camps/Product Cards: A section showcasing upcoming events or products with basic details and pricing.

Embedded Map: A placeholder for location-based services (e.g., camp venues).

"What to Expect" Section: Outlines a typical day at a camp with key activities.

Founder Section: A placeholder for information about the business's founder.

FAQ Section: Interactive accordion-style FAQ component.

Contact Form: A basic contact form for user inquiries.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web content.

CSS3: For styling, primarily through the integration of Tailwind CSS.

JavaScript: For basic client-side interactivity (though minimal in this static prototype).

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used via CDN for rapid and responsive styling.

Project Status
This project is currently a prototype/draft and is incomplete. It is a static representation designed to visualize a potential user interface and is not yet connected to any backend services or dynamic data. It serves as a foundational design concept for a future fully functional application.

Future Plans & Potential Enhancements
This prototype is intended to evolve into a more robust application. Future plans include:

Full React/React Native Implementation: Rebuilding the frontend using React (for web) or React Native (for mobile) to create a dynamic, component-based application.

Backend Integration: Connecting the frontend to a robust backend (e.g., Node.js/Express.js with MongoDB/MySQL) for managing camp registrations, user accounts, and content.

Dynamic Data: Populating content (camps, articles, FAQs) from a database rather than hardcoding it.

User Authentication: Implementing secure user login and registration.

Interactive Features: Adding dynamic features like registration flows, personalized dashboards, and real-time updates.

Comprehensive Styling: Further refining the UI/UX with custom themes and animations.
